# University Course Registration System (UCRS)

📌 Project Overview

The **University Course Registration System (UCRS)** is a web-based information system designed to manage student course enrollment, scheduling, and academic records within a university or college environment. The system provides a centralized platform that allows students to register for courses while enabling administrators, instructors, and academic advisors to manage academic data efficiently.

This project is developed as part of a **university course submission** and focuses on **system analysis and design**, including UML diagrams and documentation.

---

## Project Objectives

* Provide a centralized system for course registration
* Automate student enrollment and validation rules
* Support academic advisors in approval workflows
* Enable administrators to manage courses and users
* Integrate with external systems such as payment and academic databases

---

## System Actors

* **Student**: Browse courses, register, drop, or swap courses, and view schedules
* **Academic Advisor**: Review and approve course enrollment requests
* **Instructor**: View enrolled students and manage academic data
* **Administrator**: Manage courses, users, schedules, and system configurations

---

## System Components

* **University Course Registration System (Core System)**
* **Payment System** (external)
* **University Database** (external)

---

##  Diagrams Included

The project includes the following UML and system diagrams:

### 1️⃣ Context Diagram

* Illustrates the system boundary
* Shows interaction between UCRS and external actors/systems
* Defines how users and external systems communicate with UCRS

### 2️⃣ Activity Diagram – Student Course Registration

* Represents the workflow a student follows to register for a course
* Includes prerequisite validation, seat availability, and advisor approval
* Shows alternative flows for rejection or failure cases

### 3️⃣ Activity Diagram – Administrator Course Management

* Describes how administrators create, update, and delete courses
* Includes defining course schedules and capacity
* Ensures data is stored consistently in the university database

All diagrams are exported in **PDF/PNG format** for easy viewing and submission.
